# Placeholder for video file
# Since we cannot download the specific YouTube video due to copyright restrictions,
# this serves as a placeholder. In a real implementation, you would:
# 1. Use a royalty-free video from sources like Pexels, Unsplash, or Pixabay
# 2. Or create a custom video that represents your financial services
# 3. Ensure the video is optimized for web (H.264 codec, appropriate bitrate)
